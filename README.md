The algorithms which apply for dynamic memory allocation in the operating system are varied each by its efficiency, fragmentation and speed. The Quick Fit algorithm is a speed and efficient algorithm that can perform to allocate processes into memory. But it causes internal fragmentation which is not in contiguous memory blocks. These fragments can be reduced by merging and splitting techniques. However, there will be some certain number of fragments remaining which cannot be used to allocate another process. If there was a process which did not fit any of blocks in the block list has no space to execute. Quick fit has merging function performed to aggregate contiguous blocks and donâ€™t let those processes miss out from the allocation. If there is the process that between free memory blocks and cannot be merged the corresponding blocks because they are not contiguous. If the process has remaining amount which large fragments split using splitting technique to prevent the waste of the memory.
